     <p style="font-family:'Cutive Mono',monospace;padding:0%15%0%15%;">Depersonalization is a personal photo essay comprised of 360º photos attempting to unpack what it feels like to struggle with a mental illness that is often ignored or written off as simply a smaller symptom to other more well known ailments, such as depression or anxiety. I’ve personally struggled with depersonalization at least since I was in high school, though possibly even earlier, and have always had trouble trying to explain to others what exactly is bugging me. How do you explain that you feel unreal or like a character in some cosmic narrative without sounding more crazy than you know you are? How do you get help when you don’t know how to explain what is ailing you?
       
In the essay, I made a lot of potentially bold narrative and editing choices. From the open book poetry spoken throughout the film and the choice of using a computer voice rather than my own, to the flashing strobe lights and using the relatively new 360º/VR medium, at lot of risks were taken that I hope helped convey the sensation of depersonalization better than I would’ve been able to without them.
       
Throughout the film, I tried to contrast the feelings of blandness and numbing that come with depersonalization (which can also be caused by taking SSRIs) with how people feel normally or when they’ve suspend SSRI use by splitting the different “acts” (represented by particular colors) into two parts: one in which colors are extremely vibrant and heavily saturated and one in which the colors are more flattened, muted, and blander. As one watches the film, they may notice that as the “acts” take place, while periods of intense colors may seem like the problem may have been solved by the particular “high” the “act” details (i.e. alcohol, drugs, social interaction, art, etc.), eventually everything does fade back to the blandness of unreality.

Being interested in 360º and VR narrative, I also attempted to tackle the well documented problem of the 360º camera users’ “omnipresence” by folding it into the project itself. While I could’ve lugged a tripod around and hidden behind corners whenever I wanted to take a shot, I made the decision to hand hold the camera (in most instances) and always be present in my shots to try to give the viewer a glimpse into what people with depersonalization mean when they describe an out-of-body sensation. By constantly seeing me, you are aware that I’m there even if I’m “behind” you in the viewer in the exact same way that people that suffer from depersonalization are constantly aware of their own existence even when their depersonalization has taken a brief foray to the back burners.
       
Many sufferers of depersonalization also suffer from other mental illnesses, and for me it comes in the form of pretty acute anxiety that in certain social situations can become heightened. I tried to address this in my opening, as the robotic voice briefly hops into French to say “l’enfer to l’enfer,” subtly referencing Sartre’s No Exit and most famous quote “Hell is other people.” Getting back to the idea of anxiety and SSRI use though, the flashing lights are meant to simulate the feeling and jarringness of “brain zaps” an incredibly hard to categorize and extremely uncomfortable symptom of SSRI withdrawal.
       
In terms of the choice to use a computer voice rather than my own, it really stemmed from a few different motivations. On one hand, as a trans-humanist artist, I felt this choice reflected my own individual reality in a way that I couldn’t pass up. On another hand, using this voice gave me the opportunity to bring attention to what the core of depersonalization really is: a feeling of losing your personhood. After over five years of struggling, I have been through the ringer in terms of existential crises, constant awareness of your own consciousness does that to you. And while I like to think that I subscribe to trans-humanist philosophy because of the inherent logic behind simulation theory, in reality there is no telling the chicken from the egg in my gradual decline into depersonalization. That is to say, there is no way of knowing if I want to believe we are all just simulations of human beings millennia ago because I depersonalize or if I depersonalize because I’m really just a simulation of a fleshy human named Kadallah that is already long gone.</p>
